# Captain-Hook-Server

## Description

This is the complementary server component for [Captain Hook](https://github.com/nznznz42/Captain-Hook). You will need to deploy this to a webhost of your choice to be able to use the ctest command in Captain Hook.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following to be able to use this:

1. Webdomain with wildcard entries enabled.
2. Webhost

## Installation

This process will differ based on your hosting solution so I will describe the process I used to deploy on [Render.com](https://www.render.com).

1. Create new account
2. Click on new web service
3. Connect github to render.com
4. Click Deploy from repo after selecting this repo.
5. Configure DNS to allow domain to point to the webservice.

You can find further instructions to deploy on render.com [here](https://docs.render.com/web-services).
